# 🚀 Task Manager Assignment  

## 🎯 Objective  
Create a responsive and interactive **Task Manager** using **React.js** that allows users to manage tasks across multiple stages.  

## ✅ Must-Have Features 
- A clean and user-friendly UX
- Display a list of tasks with the following details:  
  - Title  
  - Description  
  - Stage (Pending, In Progress, Complete)  
- We should be able to:  
  - **Add** task  
  - **Edit** an existing task  
  - **Delete** task (Show a confirmation dialog before deleting task)  
  - **Change task stage** (Move tasks between Pending → In Progress → Complete)  
- Use Redux Toolkit or Context API for state management.  
- Ensure modular and reusable components.  
- Handle edge cases (e.g., empty task title, long descriptions, rapid task movements).  

## 🌟 Bonus Points  
- Implement drag and drop functionality to **reorder tasks** and to **move tasks between stages.**  
- **Persist tasks** using LocalStorage so that data is not lost on page refresh.  
- **Sync tasks** across multiple tabs (i.e., when a change is made in one tab, it should instantly reflect in other open tabs).
  

## 📦 Deliverable  
- Link to GitHub repo with a **README.md** file explaining:  
  - How to run the app locally
  - Time you took to complete the assignment
  - Brief explanation of the implementation  
  - Mention which bonus points are covered in the implementation  
- A working link of the deployed app (You can use any tool/platform you're comfortable with for deployment)
